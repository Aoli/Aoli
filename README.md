# Hi there, I'm Aoli!

## About Me
I'm passionate about building cross-platform apps with Flutter and Dart, bringing my ideas to life on iOS, Android, and the web. I'm always learning and experimenting with new projects, driven by a business mindset to create something valuable. I'm excited about the potential of AI tools like Copilot to boost my productivity and explore new possibilities.  My projects often involve user authentication and data storage using backend services like Firebase and SupaBase. I'm also eager to learn more about cloud functions to power my app's backend logic. I'm looking forward to connecting with other developers and sharing my work as I gain more confidence.

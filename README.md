# Hi there, I'm Aoli!

## About Me
I'm passionate about building cross-platform apps with Flutter and Dart, bringing my ideas to life on iOS, Android, and the web. I'm always learning and love to explore new technologies like Copilot to help me code smarter and faster.

My projects usually involve user authentication and data storage using powerful backend services like Firebase and Supabase. I'm also eager to learn more about cloud functions to make my apps even more dynamic.

I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and eventually share my creations with the world!
